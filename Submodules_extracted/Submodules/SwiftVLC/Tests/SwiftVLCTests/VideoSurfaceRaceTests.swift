/// Regression tests for the `VideoSurface` <-> libVLC decoder-thread
/// boundary during dismissal.
///
/// Before the fix, `VideoSurface.attach(to:)` handed libVLC an
/// `Unmanaged.passUnretained(self).toOpaque()` pointer via
/// `libvlc_media_player_set_nsobject`, and UIKit/AppKit could release the
/// view independently of libVLC's decode/vout thread. Dropping the view
/// without calling `detach()` first left libVLC with a dangling `void *`
/// and the next vout init dereferenced freed memory — a reproducible
/// SIGSEGV under parallel test execution.
///
/// The fix moves drawable ownership onto ``Player``: `attach` now calls
/// ``Player/setDrawable(_:)`` which strongly retains the view for the
/// lifetime of the attachment, and `Player.deinit` clears libVLC's
/// pointer *before* releasing the view. Mirrors VLCKit's `_drawable`
/// ivar pattern from `VLCMediaPlayer.m:583-592`.
///
/// These tests exercise the six dismissal patterns most likely to
/// regress that invariant. Serial `swift test` now passes all of them;
/// parallel execution still uncovers a separate upstream libupnp race in
/// renderer discovery, which is why `Integration` is `.serialized`
/// (see `BaseSuites.swift`). A headless `swift test` has no window
/// server so the macOS vout never fully spins up — these tests still
/// cover the attach/detach ordering that the bug lived in.
