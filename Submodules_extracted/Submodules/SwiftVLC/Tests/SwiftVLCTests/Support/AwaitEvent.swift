/// Fails the current test if `player` does not reach `state` before

/// and the first event.
///
/// Replaces the silent-bailout pattern
/// `guard try await poll(...) else { player.stop(); return }`, which
/// passed the test on timeout — hiding real regressions. With this
/// helper a stuck player surfaces a test failure instead of a green
/// check.
///
/// ```swift
/// let playing = subscribeAndAwait(.playing, on: player)
/// try player.play(url: ...)
/// try await requireReached(playing, "Playback never started")
/// ```

/// Subscribes to `player.events` *before* returning, so a caller can
/// kick off an action (e.g. `player.play(...)`) without racing the
/// subscription against the first event. The returned future resolves
/// when a matching `.stateChanged` event is seen or `timeout` elapses.
///
/// Subscribing from a detached task means event delivery bypasses
/// MainActor entirely — events arrive straight from the libVLC thread
/// via `AsyncStream.Continuation.yield` without having to wait for the
/// main actor to become available.

/// ```swift
/// let playing = subscribeAndAwait(.playing, on: player)
/// try player.play(...)
/// try #require(await playing.value)

///   arrives before the timeout, `false` if the stream ended or the
///   timeout elapsed first.
